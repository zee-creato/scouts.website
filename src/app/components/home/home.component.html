    <p  data-aos="fade-up"   data-aos-offset="400"    data-aos-duration="3000"   class="home__main__text__p">    Our name was chosen to celebrate our formation in the 101st year of Scouting in Odiham District. Scouting has seen a lot of changes over the last 100 years but our guiding principals have stood the test of time. Scouting is a worldwide youth movement with the stated aim of supporting young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development, so that they may play constructive roles in society.     </p>

<p  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000"  class="home__aside__middle__right__p">The 101st Odiham Scout Group was founded in 2012 to provide scouting to young people in Church Crookham and Fleet. It currently consists of one Beaver colony (ages 6 to 8), two Cub Scout packs (ages 8 to 10½) and two Scout troops (ages 10½ to 14). We meet in the Quetta Park Community Centre and Church Crookham Junior School.
    Odiham District is now the largest of the 27 Districts in Hampshire – which in itself is the largest Scout county in the country. Within our District we have quite a large joining list for youngsters that would like to take part in Scouting, but for whom there isn’t space at the moment. We have the opportunity to start a second Beaver Colony and a second Scout Troop within our Group, but in order to be able to do that we need adults to volunteer to assist with the running of the new Colony. Don’t worry if you’ve never done anything like this before – there’s plenty of assistance and training and you won’t be thrown in at the deep-end with 24 new Beavers! When we started the in 2012, most of our current leaders had never done anything like this before either – now they are running successful units.
    If you are able to assist, please contact Andrew, our Group Scout Leader.</p>

        They will also have the opportunity to take part in the fun and excitement of camps and sleepovers. It may be the first time they spend a night away from home so it’s a real adventure for them.   </p>
